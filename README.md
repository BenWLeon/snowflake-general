# Boilerplates | Scripts | Automation | Documentation

## A source of truth for admins and developers at Pandata Group

This repository is useful for both reference and implementation of internal and client facing applications. It should serve as primary documentation on best practices and a glimpse of useful implementations.

* The boilerplate's will provide code and helpful explanations
* Scripts for security, automation, governance, and more
* Documentation from an IaC (Infrastructure as Code) approach
* Helpful for setting up various integrations in/with Snowflake

> [!NOTE]  
> Robustness and thoroughness may vary as admins and developers capacity changes. Projects may be refined or expanded on in practice but not in documentation, we try.
